# CPP-Traits
Experimentation with C++ type traits.

CPP Type traits are both simple and complex at the same time. This repo is an attempt to play with them. This will help me learn to understand them better and may provide examples for others to consider.

# IDE
I'm currently using Qt Creator, which works from the included .pro file. But there's nothing else IDE-specific about this project, and feel free to use whatever tool you prefer.

# License
I prefer the MIT license, a copy of which is found in LICENSE.

# Where to Start
Begin with Start.cpp.
